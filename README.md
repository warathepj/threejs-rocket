# Three.js Rocket Project

A simple interactive 3D rocket animation built with Three.js and cannon-es.

## Features

*   **Rocket Launch Animation**: Watch a low-poly rocket launch and accelerate into the sky.
*   **Physics-Based Motion**: Utilizes cannon-es for realistic physics simulation.
*   **Dynamic Camera**: The camera follows the rocket's trajectory after launch.
*   **On-Screen Display**: Real-time display of elapsed time and rocket velocity.
*   **Visual Effects**: Includes a starfield background, rocket exhaust cones, and vibration effects at high speed.
